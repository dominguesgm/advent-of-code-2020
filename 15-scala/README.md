# Scala

Scala seemed interesting enough, even though this exercise didn't exactly provide that much of a chance to learn about the language.

Case in point, the second part of the exercise is exactly like the first one (this is why I only have one `ex1` project directory), only instead of wanting to know the `2020th` number spoken, the requirement is the `30000000th` number spoken. It takes a bit longer to run the program but it still works nonetheless.

Notes about scala, read the `Game` file (for example, `var`s are variables, `val`s are immutable). There are also mutable and immutable versions of most data structs. The concepts of `case classes`, `traits`(similar to interfaces) and `objects` (nothing to do with js, more like a singleton) are interesting, but I didn't get a chance to use them
