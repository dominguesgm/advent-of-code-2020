# Ruby

As expected from when I used ruby back in my thesis, I really enjoyed doing this exercise in it. Though I needed a of a refresher, since I hadn't used the language for 2 years.

Problem 2 maybe had a better way to be solved (if any mask has a large number of X's, this solution will take forever). I'll probably write a bit more about the language and the problems later.

Sadly I didn't find it necessary to use extra functionalities like classes, etc. I recall really liking the method names being indicative of if they are a query (with a `?` at the end of the method name) or if they're `dangerous methods` which change objects they interact with (that is, non pure, with a `!` at the end of the method's name).
